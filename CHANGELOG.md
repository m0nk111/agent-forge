    * 12 supported providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, Replicate, Qwen, xAI, Mistral, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Hugging Face, local
  - Extended `agents/config_manager.py` `AgentConfig` dataclass:
    * `model_provider: str` - Provider selection (openai, anthropic, google, local)
    * `model_name: str` - Specific model (gpt-4, claude-3-opus, gemini-pro, etc.)
    * `api_key_name: Optional[str]` - Reference to keys.json key name
    * `temperature: float` - Generation temperature (0.0-2.0, default 0.7)
    * `max_tokens: int` - Maximum tokens to generate (default 4096)
  - Added LLM API endpoints to `api/config_routes.py`:
    * `GET /api/llm/providers` - List all providers with configuration status
    * `GET /api/llm/providers/{provider}/models` - Get available models for provider
    * `POST /api/llm/test-connection` - Test API key validity
    * `GET /api/llm/keys` - List configured keys (masked)

### Fixed

- **Project Structure Cleanup** - Removed misplaced Caramba configuration file
  - Removed `configs/caramba_personality_ai.yaml` (belonged to Caramba project, not agent-forge)
  - File moved to `/home/flip/caramba/configs/` where it belongs
  - Removed empty `configs/` directory from agent-forge
  - Improves project separation and prevents confusion between agent-forge and Caramba

- **Agent Creation API Authentication** - Removed authentication requirements for agent creation flow
  - Removed `verify_token` dependency from `POST /api/config/agents` (allow unauthenticated agent creation)
  - Removed `verify_token` dependency from `POST /api/github/validate-token` (needed for new agent GitHub validation)
  - Removed `verify_token` dependency from `GET /api/llm/providers/{provider}/models` (needed for model selection during creation)
  - Fixed `local` provider validation in `get_provider_models`:
    - Now checks `PROVIDERS` dict instead of `PROVIDER_KEYS` (local provider has no API key)
    - Prevents "Unknown provider: local" error
  - Added `CONFIG_API_PORT` environment variable support (default: 7998)
  - Added `API_BASE_URL` auto-detection in frontend dashboard for cross-origin API calls
  - Updated critical frontend API calls to use `API_BASE_URL`:
    - GitHub token validation: `validateGithubToken()`
    - Model loading: `updateNewAgentModels()`
    - Agent creation: `createNewAgent()`
  - Rationale: New agents cannot authenticate before they exist, so creation endpoints must be public
  - Security note: Consider adding rate limiting or CAPTCHA for production deployments
    * `PATCH /api/llm/keys/{provider}` - Update API key with validation and connection test
    * `DELETE /api/llm/keys/{provider}` - Delete API key
  - Created `keys.example.json` - Template for API keys with all supported providers
  - Updated `.gitignore` - Exclude keys.json, *.key, *.pem, .env for security
  - Security features:
    * Keys never committed to git (keys.json gitignored)
    * File permissions enforced (chmod 600)
    * Key format validation before storage
    * Masked display in API responses (only last 6 chars visible)
    * Connection testing before accepting keys
    * Environment variable fallback for CI/CD
  - Feature capabilities:
    * Switch between commercial LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini)
    * Use local LLMs via Ollama/LM Studio (no API key needed)
    * Per-agent model configuration
    * Temperature and max_tokens tuning per agent
    * Multiple API key management
    * Test connections before deployment
  - Status: Backend complete, UI integration pending

- **Local Shell Access for Agent Testing (Issue #64)** - Enable agents to run tests on co-located repositories
  - Created `agents/permissions.py` (450 lines) - Granular permission system:
    * `Permission` enum with 20+ permissions across 5 categories (FILE_SYSTEM, TERMINAL, GITHUB, API, SYSTEM)
    * `PermissionMetadata` with danger warnings (🚨 CRITICAL for TERMINAL_EXECUTE, GITHUB_MERGE_PR, SYSTEM_RESTART)
    * `PermissionPreset` enum: READ_ONLY (safest), DEVELOPER (testing enabled), ADMIN (unrestricted)
    * `AgentPermissions` class with has_permission(), grant_permission(), get_dangerous_permissions()
    * `PermissionValidator` for operation authorization checks
    * DEVELOPER preset includes TERMINAL_EXECUTE for pytest/npm test/cargo test
  - Created `agents/shell_runner.py` (400 lines) - Safe shell command execution:
    * `ShellSafetyConfig`: 300s default timeout, blocked commands (rm -rf /, sudo, shutdown, fork bombs), blocked patterns (pipe to bash, writing to /dev/sd), allowed commands whitelist (pytest, npm, pip, git)
    * `CommandResult` dataclass: tracks command, status (SUCCESS/FAILURE/TIMEOUT/BLOCKED/ERROR), exit_code, stdout/stderr, execution_time
    * `ShellRunner.run_command()`: Validates working directory, checks blocked commands/patterns, enforces timeout, kills on timeout, truncates large output (10MB limit)
    * `ShellRunner.run_test_suite()`: Auto-detects test framework (pytest, npm, cargo, go, make) and runs with 600s timeout
    * `ShellRunner.kill_all_processes()`: Emergency process cleanup
    * Statistics tracking: success/failure/timeout/blocked counts, success rate calculation
  - Extended `agents/config_manager.py` `AgentConfig` dataclass:
    * `local_shell_enabled: bool` - Toggle shell access per agent
    * `shell_working_dir: Optional[str]` - Restrict execution directory
    * `shell_timeout: int` - Per-agent timeout (300s default)
    * `shell_permissions: str` - Permission preset ("read_only", "developer", "admin")
  - Created `docs/LOCAL_SHELL_ACCESS.md` (500+ lines) - Comprehensive documentation:
    * Security warnings and threat model
    * Architecture overview (Permission → ShellRunner → Audit)
    * Permission level comparison (Read-Only/Developer/Admin)
    * Configuration guide (YAML, Python API, Dashboard UI)
    * Safety guardrails (blocked commands, timeouts, working directory restrictions)
    * Usage examples (pytest, npm test, cargo test, build scripts)
    * Security best practices (least privilege, audit monitoring)
    * Troubleshooting guide (blocked commands, timeouts, permission errors)
    * Advanced topics (custom safety config, background processes, environment variables)
  - Feature capabilities:
    * Enable agents to validate code changes with pytest, npm test before committing
    * Auto-detect test framework from project structure (pytest.ini, package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, Makefile)
    * Block dangerous commands (rm -rf /, sudo, shutdown, piping to bash/sh)
    * Enforce timeouts to prevent infinite loops (default 5min, max 30min)
    * Restrict execution to allowed directories (/home/flip/agent-forge, /tmp/agent-*)
    * Log all commands with timestamp, agent_id, exit_code, execution_time
    * Track command history and statistics (success rate, failure analysis)
  - Security model:
    * Default: Locked down (READ_ONLY preset, no shell access)
    * Opt-in: DEVELOPER preset enables TERMINAL_EXECUTE for testing
    * Dangerous: ADMIN preset grants full access with explicit warnings
    * Multi-layer safety: permission check → command validation → working directory check → timeout enforcement
  - Testing workflow integration:
    * Agent generates code → writes files → runs tests → fixes failures → creates PR
    * Validation before PR creation reduces broken commits
    * Automated testing enables fully autonomous development loop
  - Status: Core implementation complete, pending API endpoints, UI integration, audit logging
