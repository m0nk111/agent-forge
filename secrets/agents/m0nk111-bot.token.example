# GitHub Personal Access Token for m0nk111-bot
# 
# This file is a placeholder. To enable the bot agent, you need to:
#
# 1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (classic) for the m0nk111-bot account
#    - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
#    - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
#    - Select scopes:
#      ✅ repo (Full control of private repositories)
#      ✅ workflow (Update GitHub Action workflows)
#      ✅ write:discussion (Read and write discussions)
#      ✅ write:org (Read and write org and team membership)
#      ✅ read:user (Read user profile data)
#      ✅ read:project (Read project cards and boards)
#
# 2. Copy the token and save it in this file (without this comment block)
#    $ echo "ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" > secrets/agents/m0nk111-bot.token
#
# 3. Set proper permissions (IMPORTANT for security)
#    $ chmod 600 secrets/agents/m0nk111-bot.token
#
# 4. Verify the token works
#    $ curl -H "Authorization: token $(cat secrets/agents/m0nk111-bot.token)" https://api.github.com/user
#
# 5. Restart the agent-forge service
#    $ systemctl restart agent-forge
#
# SECURITY NOTES:
# - NEVER commit tokens to git
# - NEVER share tokens in chat/email
# - The bot account should have "Triage" role on repositories (not "Write")
# - Bot agent has read-only file permissions and no shell access
# - Bot can manage issues, labels, and projects but cannot merge PRs
#
# For more details, see: docs/AGENT_ROLES.md (Bot Role section)

# Uncomment and replace with your actual token:
# ghp_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
