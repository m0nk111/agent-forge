### Step 1: Understand Requirements
Review the project requirements to ensure a clear understanding of what changes are needed.

### Step 2: Plan Changes
Create a detailed plan outlining the steps required to implement the changes. Include timelines and dependencies.

### Step 3: Make Changes
Edit the necessary files to implement the required changes. Ensure all changes adhere to code standards and best practices.

### Step 4: Run Local Tests
Ensure that all local tests pass before proceeding to the next step. If any tests fail, debug and fix the issues.

### Step 5: Review and Refine
Review the implemented changes for accuracy and completeness. Make any necessary refinements to ensure the solution meets the project requirements.

### Step 6: Document Changes
Create a document detailing the changes made, including any new features, bug fixes, and improvements. Ensure the documentation is clear and comprehensive.

## Document Created

After completing all steps outlined above, create a comprehensive document detailing the changes made:

- **Step 1:** Understand Requirements - Reviewed the project requirements to ensure clarity.
  
- **Step 2:** Plan Changes - Developed a detailed plan with timelines and dependencies.
  
- **Step 3:** Make Changes - Implemented necessary code edits following best practices.
  
- **Step 4:** Run Local Tests - Executed all local tests, fixing any issues that arose.
  
- **Step 5:** Review and Refine - Reviewed changes for accuracy and made necessary refinements.
  
- **Step 6:** Document Changes - Created a detailed document outlining the changes, new features, bug fixes, and improvements.
