# Architecture

This section provides a detailed overview of the Agent-Forge system architecture.

## Components

The system is composed of several key components:

- **Engine**: The core of the platform, containing the logic for agent management, task orchestration, and execution.
- **API**: A set of RESTful APIs for interacting with the platform, managing agents, and configuring services.
- **Frontend**: A web-based user interface for monitoring and managing the platform.
- **Scripts**: A collection of utility scripts for development, deployment, and maintenance.
