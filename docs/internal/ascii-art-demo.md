## Description

ASCII art is a graphic design technique that uses printable characters from the ASCII standard to create images and designs. Dating back to the early days of computing when graphical displays were limited or unavailable, ASCII art remains popular for:

- **Simplicity**: Works in any text editor or terminal
- **Portability**: No special graphics libraries needed
- **Creativity**: Turning limitations into artistic expression
- **Nostalgia**: Reminds us of early computer culture
- **Accessibility**: Can be read by screen readers and text-based browsers

The sun and chair depicted above demonstrate how simple characters can combine to create recognizable objects. The sun's rays spread outward from a central circle, while the chair's structure clearly shows a seat, backrest, and legs - all fundamental furniture design elements rendered in pure text.

ASCII art continues to thrive in modern contexts like email signatures, source code comments, and retro-styled digital art. It's a reminder that creativity doesn't always require sophisticated tools - sometimes, simple characters arranged thoughtfully can convey meaning and beauty just as effectively.
