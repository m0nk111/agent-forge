**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Affected Account:** m0nk111-bot  
**Request Type:** Account Suspension Inquiry & Reinstatement

## Support Request Message

**Subject:** Account Suspension Inquiry - m0nk111-bot - Request for Information and Reinstatement

**Body:**

Hello GitHub Support Team,

I am writing to inquire about the suspension of my GitHub account **m0nk111-bot** and to request information about the reason for this action.

### Account Details
- **Username:** m0nk111-bot
- **Account Type:** Machine/Bot Account
- **Created:** Approximately October 2025
- **Purpose:** Automated development assistant for the agent-forge project
- **Associated Repository:** https://github.com/m0nk111/agent-forge

### Current Situation
When attempting to access the account or use its API token, I receive:
- API Response: `404 Not Found` when querying `/users/m0nk111-bot`
- Token Status: `401 Bad credentials`

This indicates the account may have been suspended or removed.

### Usage Pattern
According to my logs, this account had **minimal to no activity** before the suspension:
- **Total API calls:** Approximately 546 calls over 3-4 days (well within normal limits)
- **No spam behavior detected** in our monitoring systems
- **No comments or issues created** by this account
- **No pull requests** submitted
- The account was primarily used for authentication testing during setup

### Bot Configuration
The account was configured as:
- A machine user for automated GitHub operations
- Rate-limited to prevent abuse (3 comments/min, 30/hour, 200/day)
- Cooldown periods enforced (20s between comments, 60s between issues)
- Duplicate detection to prevent spam
- Burst protection (max 10 operations/minute)

### Questions
1. **What was the specific reason for the account suspension?**
   - Was it flagged as spam/abuse?
   - Did it violate GitHub's Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policy?
   - Was it suspended for lack of proper bot identification?
   - Was there an issue with the authentication method?

2. **Can the account be reinstated?**
   - If so, what steps do I need to take?
   - Are there specific requirements for bot accounts I should follow?
   - Do I need to apply for a GitHub App instead?

3. **Should I create a new account or apply for reinstatement?**
   - If a new account is recommended, what should I do differently?
   - Are there specific bot naming conventions or setup requirements?

### Actions Taken
To prevent any future issues, I have already implemented:
- ✅ Comprehensive rate limiting system
- ✅ Anti-spam protection with multiple safeguards
- ✅ Removed all hardcoded tokens from codebase
- ✅ Proper token security (600 permissions, .gitignore patterns)
- ✅ Operation tracking and monitoring
- ✅ Compliance with GitHub API best practices

### Context
This is part of an open-source autonomous development platform project. The bot account was intended to:
- Manage GitHub operations without generating email notifications to the main account
- Provide automated issue management
- Create comments and pull requests as part of the development workflow

### Request
I kindly request:
1. **Information** about why the account was suspended
2. **Guidance** on how to properly set up bot accounts for GitHub operations
3. **Reinstatement** of the m0nk111-bot account, if possible
4. **Recommendations** for compliant bot usage going forward

I am committed to following all GitHub policies and guidelines. If the suspension was due to a misconfiguration or misunderstanding of the requirements, I am happy to make any necessary changes.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response and guidance on this matter.

Best regards,  
Flip
