# Provisional Goal: Full Issue-to-Agent Automation

## Objective

Until the platform can automatically:

1. Detect a newly created GitHub issue.
2. Assign an Agent Forge automation agent to that issue without manual intervention.
3. Execute the issue request end-to-end, including tasks such as:
   - Generating ASCII art (e.g., a chair, diagram, or other character-based illustration).
   - Writing creative text (e.g., poems, short research notes like on a goldfish).
   - Implementing functional code modules (e.g., a screen-bouncing module).
4. Produce pull requests and documentation updates that satisfy the issue requirements.

â€¦the current development effort remains incomplete.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Issue lifecycle is autonomous from creation through PR submission.
- The assigned agent logs demonstrate task inference, execution, and validation without human prompts.
- Artifacts (Markdown, code, docs) reflect the specific requests in the originating issue.
- Monitoring and testing confirm repeatability across multiple creative task types.

## Next Steps

- Finalize GitHub issue claiming and agent assignment hooks.
- Expand test coverage beyond sun diagrams to chairs, poems, research summaries, and code modules.
- Integrate PR creation and review workflows tailored to creative outputs.
- Document validation procedures once the automation loop is operational.
